Sequence of operations on the xml

CURRENT
1) Put filenames in a list (DONE)
2) Load XML objects in to lists in a dataframe, drop the empties (DONE)
3) Unwind the lists stuck inside cells of dataframe so they are single objects


BETTER
1) Put filenames in a list (DONE)
2) Load the XML objects in to a list by file (many objects per row, remove empties)
3) Process this list in to one object per row
