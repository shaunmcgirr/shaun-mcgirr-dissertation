# Background information on the government procurement data stored on zakupki.gov.ru

Since 1 Jan 2011, the majority of government procurement in Russia has run through the portal located at zakupki.gov.ru. Government agencies list requests to purchase goods or services in documents called "notifications", potential suppliers submit bids known as "protocols", and the final transactions are documented in "contracts".

All this happens via a web-based front-end accessible at http://zakupki.gov.ru. For a variety of purposes, a daily backup of the underlying data is available at ftp.zakupki.gov.ru for read-only access.
